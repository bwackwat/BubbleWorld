# "Anything can be made out of circles it seems!"

Each directory contains at least one executable Java program.

To build all of the programs:
```./compile-or-run```

To run a program:
```./compile-or-run <program-directory-name>```
e.g. ```./compile-or-run Organisms```

To run an alternate program
```./compile-or-run <program-directory-name> <main-class-name>```
e.g. ```./compile-or-run MultiplayerGame GameClient```
